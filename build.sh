# --- Signing / notarization ---
# For a clean (no Gatekeeper warning) release you need, set up once on this Mac:
#   1. A "Developer ID Application" certificate in your keychain (Xcode > Settings > Accounts).
#   2. A notarytool credential profile named the same as NOTARY_PROFILE below — the name in
#      this line used to be upstream's, so anyone following it stored a profile this script
#      then failed to find, and the build fell through to an unnotarized DMG:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "claude-control-bar" \
#          --apple-id you@example.com --team-id <YOUR TEAM ID> --password <app-specific-password>
# Then `./build.sh --dmg` auto-signs + notarizes. Without a cert it falls back to an
# ad-hoc dev build (runnable locally; users would need right-click > Open once).
# Was hardcoded to upstream's Apple Team ID, which is nobody's cert here: the grep never
# matched, the script fell through to ad-hoc signing AND skipped notarization entirely, and
# said so only in a line nobody reads. Unset now means "any Developer ID in the keychain",
# and REQUIRE_NOTARIZE=1 makes a release build fail loudly instead of shipping unnotarized.
