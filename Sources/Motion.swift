/// Reduce Motion setting, or the user's own pick in Settings — and durations spread across six
/// files cannot be switched off at all. It is static state rather than a value threaded through
/// every view because the answer is the same for the whole app at any instant, and the window
/// chrome that asks (PanelWindow) is AppKit with nowhere to carry an Environment value.
///
/// The budget every rule here defends: an animation is committed once and then interpolated by the
/// render server, so the process does no work per frame. Nothing in this file may introduce a Timer
/// or a per-frame redraw. That, and not the number of animations, is what would cost a menu bar
/// app its battery.
