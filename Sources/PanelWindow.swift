// say so at the top, and docs/motion.md still records what that cost: no accordion, no tab switch,

// that was rejected here: it brings its own light bubble and anchor arrow, foreign against the
// menu material this app is drawn on.
//
// So: the same shape HoverCard already uses — a borderless window at .popUpMenu level over an
// NSVisualEffectView — with the two differences a panel needs and a hover card must not have. It
// takes mouse events, and it can become key, because every control in it is clickable and the
